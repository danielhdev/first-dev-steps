My first baby steps as a developer in 2022

The sources helping me to learn the basics and making my decision 
to become a developer easy: 

www.freecodecamp.org and their great HTML and CSS courses.

Also the YouTube channels <br> 
Web Dev Simplified, <br> 
JavaSript King, <br> 
Tech With Tim, <br> 
Traversy Media <br>  

for beginner lessons in JS and Python.
